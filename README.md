- that commit message is "sharing for(not got) whoever need its".

### Warning
- This is an and old project I made just to experiment with android based webscraping.
- This is not a regularily maintained project, beacuse it have almost no commerial use, It can't be put on playstore as I don't think scraping sites like this is legeal.(This is made just for educational purpose).

### Features
- Initially it only scrapes Amazon and Flipkart sites. But you can add more by just simple modifications to code.
- It taked a queary and scrapes its search results for title,image,price,rating and url.

### Maintenace
- E-commerce sites upadate there code regularily to prevent scraping. So if you find that application is not working , then you need to update scraping queaies in BackgroundWorker.java file.
- To do this, queary something e-commerce site and find classes or Id's of elements that you want to scrape.
- If you want to scape more elemtn kindly update details.java too.

## This project is no longer maintained.
